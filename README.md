A mechanistic interpretability tool for finding and visualizing features within neural networks (both for individual neurons and for entire layers or circuits)

# Features coming soon:
- Enable the finding of neurons and/or circuits associated with specific input images
- Combining multiple layers or multiple neurons from different layers
