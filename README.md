# feature-visualization
A mechanistic interpretability tool for finding and visualizing features within neural networks (both for individual neurons and for entire layers or circuits).

Based off ideas and results from Chris Olah's distil paper: https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/

# Features coming soon:
- Enable the finding of neurons and/or circuits associated with specific input images
- Combining multiple layers or multiple neurons from different layers
